              <li>
                The above graph represents the potential of an individual. It has been expressed in terms of Interest and Aptitude of the student. Once students know their potential it will be easy for them to take decisions related to subjects.
              </li>
              <li>
                The aptitude of an individual is neither the knowledge nor understanding level but the inherent capacity, talent or ability to perform a given task. Having a high aptitude for a field means you are naturally good at doing that.
              </li>
              <li>
                Interest is defined as a state of curiosity or inclination and is closely related to emotions. If we have interest in a particular process or work, we tend to have strong emotions for it, which enhances the probability of success as we are willing to give our hundred percent.
              </li>
              <li>
                Considering only aptitude and no interest means that the person will be able to do the task but not for a prolonged period of time and considering only interest means that the person may or may not have the skills and abilities to the task properly for which he or she is interested.
