                <li>
                  Being in social work career will get you lots of respect from society when compared to being engineer. But being a social worker would mean travel and less comfortable life as one requires to fight and help downtrodden.

                It may be true that with hard work and determination, one can perform well in any field. However, having an aptitude for that field can make things much easier. But what is aptitude? In the simplest of terms, Aptitude is nothing but the natural ease of learning something. And if that is there, a career journey can become very easy. Hence, it becomes essen$al that you know your aptitude and choose a career.
              </p>
              <p>
                For example, if your verbal communication skills are at VERY GOOD level, which means have high aptitude in that. However, your writing skills or your body language may be at average level or even below average. In such case you need to focus more on the low aptitude areas. This is the advantage of specifically identifying the problem areas. It reduces the amount of effort you need to put on your training for the improvements.

              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>"Interests"</strong> are those activities you do for fun or enjoyment, including <strong>what you like to read, the TV shows and movies you like to watch, events you like to attend, and the kind of people you admire and like to be with.</strong>

                Interest is important in choosing a career or occupation because interest keeps you motivated and engaged in your work. Since work takes up most of your time during a day and week, if you have no interest in what you are doing, you will most likely become unhappy and unproductive.

                We all have distinguished personality traits, like a few of us are more analytical in nature, while others may have an artistic bent of mind. One may be good at managing numbers, other may excel at handling people. These qualities in us can have a great impact on the career we choose. Hence, keeping in mind one's personality trait will help in making one's career easy. These inbuilt skills will help shape the career smoothly and the chosen job will not be a big task.

                For example, someone who is introvert by nature will find it quite difficult to be in a sales job as the work requires a go-ge5er aptitude. Yet another instance is someone without the sense of language appreciation will not be suitable for an editorial job.
